# Quantum Job Shop Scheduling Problem Solver

A heuristic approach on how to optimally schedule jobs using a quantum computer.

*Publication can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_39).*

**NOTE:** for a more efficient solution check out the "pyqubo" branch. \
(works extremely slowly while using simulation instead of real qpu.)

## About The Project

<img src="visualization.gif"/>

*Note: Numbers in bars represent jobs*

Given a set of jobs and a finite number of machines, how should we schedule our jobs
on those machines such that all our jobs are completed at the earliest possible time?
This question is the job shop scheduling problem!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* python 3.5 or later
* matplotlib (for results visualisation in [charts.py](charts.py))

```
pip3 install matplotlib
```

* D'Wave's libraries for interaction with QPU API

### Installation
**NOTE:** If you are okay with using a simulator instead of a real QPU, jump to part 3.
1. Get free API Key at https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap
2. Configure a solver at https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/dwavesys.html#dwavesys
